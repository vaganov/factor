.SH NAME
\fBfactor\fR \- factor integer into prime degrees
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fB#include <factor.h>
.P
\fBuint32_t factor (uint64_t \fIn\fB, struct degree* \fId\fB, uint64_t* \fIr\fB);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBfactor()\fR factors integer \fIn\fR into product of prime degrees; these prime degrees are stored in array \fId \fRof \fBstruct degree\fR, which consists of prime number \fIp\fR and integer degree \fIb\fR; prime degrees in \fId\fR are sorted by \fIp\fR; besides, \fIn\fR can have \fBthe only\fR prime divisor greater than \fB2^32\fR; if \fIn\fR has one, its value is stored in \fB*\fIr\fR, otherwise \fB*\fIr\fR is set to \fB1\fR; for \fIn\fB = 0 *\fIr\fR is set to \fB0\fR; also \fIr\fR can be passed as null pointer (e.g. for \fIn\fB < 2^32\fR)
.SH RETURN VALUE
total number of prime degrees stored in \fId\fR is returned; this number does not exceed \fB15\fR for \fIn\fB < 2^64\fR and \fB9\fR for \fIn\fB < 2^32
